## ELgo

This is a cheat tool for CS:GO, created using Microsoft Visual Studio (C++).

### Purpose

This project was created for technical and stand-alone use. It was not intended for widespread distribution or use in competitive play but rather as a personal exploration into game modifications and automation.

## Update for 2024

I developed this script during high school (F3-F4, 2018-2019). Previously, this project was closed-source, but I’ve decided to make it open-source now.

### Will You Continue Development?

Since I’ve been using GNU/Linux as my daily driver for a long time, Windows software is no longer a priority for me. Therefore, I won’t be focusing on Windows-related updates. In short, the answer is `No`.

To be honest, the game that was dear to my heart has already been taken down. Even if CS2 becomes available on Proton while supports GNU/Linux, I probably won’t create cheats again. If circumstances change, this project might commit again, but for now, there will be no further development.
